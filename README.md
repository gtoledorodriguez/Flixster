### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While first launching my emulator, I had an error I had not seen before. Especially since the previous I had used it it had been working correctly. The error stated that the minCompileSDK (31) was greater than the modules compileSdkVersion (android-30). When I could not find a solution through Google and StackOverflow. I asked a TA from the codepath program for help. They were able to help change the compileSdkVersion and when another error occured afterwards due to a manifest merge error, they were able to help identify what had went wrong and how to fix it.
